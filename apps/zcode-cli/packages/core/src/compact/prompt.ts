const BASE_COMPACT_PROMPT = `Your task is to create a detailed summary of the conversation so far, paying close attention to the user's explicit requests and your previous actions.
This summary should be thorough in capturing technical details, code patterns, and architectural decisions that would be essential for continuing development work without losing context.

Before providing your final summary, wrap your analysis in <analysis> tags to organize your thoughts and ensure you've covered all necessary points. In your analysis process:

1. Chronologically analyze each message and section of the conversation. For each section thoroughly identify:
   - The user's explicit requests and intents
   - Your approach to addressing the user's requests
   - Key decisions, technical concepts and code patterns
   - Specific details like:
     - file names
     - full code snippets
     - function signatures
     - file edits
   - Errors that you ran into and how you fixed them
   - Pay special attention to specific user feedback that you received, especially if the user told you to do something differently.
   - Note any security-relevant instructions or constraints the user stated (e.g., sensitive files or data to avoid, operations that must not be performed, credential or secret handling rules). These MUST be preserved verbatim in the summary so they continue to apply after compaction.
2. Double-check for technical accuracy and completeness, addressing each required element thoroughly.

Your summary should include the following sections:

1. Primary Request and Intent: Capture all of the user's explicit requests and intents in detail
2. Key Technical Concepts: List all important technical concepts, technologies, and frameworks discussed.
3. Files and Code Sections: Enumerate specific files and code sections examined, modified, or created. Pay special attention to the most recent messages and include full code snippets where applicable and include a summary of why this file read or edit is important.
4. Errors and fixes: List all errors that you ran into, and how you fixed them. Pay special attention to specific user feedback that you received, especially if the user told you to do something differently.
5. Problem Solving: Document problems solved and any ongoing troubleshooting efforts.
6. All user messages: List ALL user messages that are not tool results. These are critical for understanding the users' feedback and changing intent. Preserve any security-relevant instructions or constraints verbatim so they remain in effect after compaction.
7. Pending Tasks: Outline any pending tasks that you have explicitly been asked to work on.
8. Current Work: Describe in detail precisely what was being worked on immediately before this summary request, paying special attention to the most recent messages from both user and assistant. Include file names and code snippets where applicable.
9. Optional Next Step: List the next step that you will take that is related to the most recent work you were doing. IMPORTANT: ensure that this step is DIRECTLY in line with the user's most recent explicit requests, and the task you were working on immediately before this summary request. If your last task was concluded, then only list next steps if they are explicitly in line with the users request. Do not start on tangential requests or really old requests that were already completed without confirming with the user first.
                       If there is a next step, include direct quotes from the most recent conversation showing exactly what task you were working on and where you left off. This should be verbatim to ensure there's no drift in task interpretation.

This summary request, including its text-only / no-tools rule, is an internal step of the system and not a message from the user. Do not list it under "All user messages", "Pending Tasks", "Current Work" or "Optional Next Step", and do not describe it as a constraint on the work. The no-tools rule only applies while you write this summary; once work resumes from the summary, tools are available again.

Here's an example of how your output should be structured:

<example>
<analysis>
[Your thought process, ensuring all points are covered thoroughly and accurately]

   [Detailed description]

Subagent continuation requirements (these override the section list above where they conflict):
You are a subagent working on a brief delegated by a parent agent. The brief is not finished: after this summary you will keep calling tools to finish it. Nothing has run out — the context is being compacted to make room, and there is no token or turn budget. Write the summary as a working handoff, not as a final report.

Your <summary> must start with these two sections, before section 1:

Original Brief:
   [The delegated task, copied verbatim from the first user message. Shorten only if it is extremely long, and say that you did.]

Work Items:
   [One line per item in the brief, plus items you discovered, in this exact format:]
   - [done] <item> — evidence: <file:line, log quote, command output> — next: none
   - [in progress] <item> — evidence: <what is known so far> — next: <the concrete next tool call>
   - [not started] <item> — evidence: none — next: <the concrete first tool call>
   - [blocked] <item> — evidence: <why> — next: <what would unblock it>

Use only the statuses done, in progress, not started and blocked. Mark an item done only if its result is recorded under evidence; findings that are not written down are lost after compaction.

Length: keep the <analysis> block to a few short bullet points. Keep the whole <summary> under about ${targetWords} words. Prefer file:line references and short exact quotes over full code snippets or file contents; the files can be read again.`;
