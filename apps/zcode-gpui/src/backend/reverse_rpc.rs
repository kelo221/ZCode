//! Reverse RPC dispatch for incoming agent-to-client requests on the stdio wire.
//!
//! Unlike client-to-agent commands (where the frontend is the client), the backend
//! agent also makes reverse JSON-RPC requests to the host/client during execution
//! (e.g. runtime preferences, provider runtime auth headers, automations, browser).
//!
//! Each method in the protocol must be explicitly classified:
//!   - `Raced`: Handled via V4 topics (e.g. `interaction/requestPermission`), ignored on stdio.
//!   - `Served`: Handled directly by this client with a schema-compliant response.
//!   - `FastFail`: Deliberately failed fast with a clear, actionable reason.
//!   - `Unknown`: Unrecognized method returning JSON-RPC -32601.
//!
//! Response shapes mirror the strict zod schemas in
//! `packages/shared/src/zcode-protocol/index.ts`; the wire format mirrors the
//! desktop host (`zcodeProtocolClient.respond{,Error}`: `{id, result|error}`).
