# GPUI Frontend Parity Plan

Status: **action-level audit updated 2026-10-06**. The first Settings/safety slice is
implemented; the broader parity backlog is not complete. This file is the domain spec
for `apps/zcode-gpui`: update it before changing behavior. Current status and evidence
limits below take precedence over the retained historical milestone requirements.

## Approved real-management extension (2026-10-06)

The native-only slice implements opt-in local Subagents management with the unchanged
full Services Host and rebuilds the rejected inventory using the Desktop reference. Actual
native visual acceptance remains unverified; see SETTINGS_ACCEPTANCE.md.
SERVICES_RPC.md defines preference suspension/drain and observed Host exit before writes
resume. SUBAGENTS_SETTINGS.md defines activation, recovery and compact grouped/inline UI.
Earlier isolated evidence is not acceptance of this extension. Backend stays frozen; no
real configuration is used during automated/native acceptance. Existing migrations/metadata
rewrite and unsupported cross-process coexistence are disclosed, not claimed solved.

## 1. Goal, scope, guardrails

**Stack note (2026-10-03):** `gpui` is now pinned to the exact zed revision that
`ely-gpui-component` targets (git rev `1a28cff`, 2026-09-27) so both build one shared
gpui; `gpui_platform::application()` replaces the removed `Application::new`. ely is
initialized in `main.rs` with its assets/fonts. The serialized preference owner applies
Ely mode/font scale and the legacy semantic color/typography adapters together. New
Settings controls use Ely directly; legacy views remain incrementally migrated.

**Goal**: the GPUI client is a daily driver that a ZCode user can run _instead of_ the
Electron app for coding work, at a fraction of the memory, without forking the backend.

**Guardrails** (unchanged from v1, still binding):

1. **Zero backend forks.** Only wire surfaces that exist in
   `packages/shared/src/zcode-protocol*` (V4 topics/commands + legacy method registry).
   Branch exception (feat/gpui-frontend, personal branch): one runtime-portability
   change in `apps/zcode-cli/packages/core/src/environment.ts` (`node:sea` probed through
   `process.getBuiltinModule`) so the CLI runs under bun. It touches no wire protocol.
2. **Ownership stays put.** Agent lifecycle, CommandInbox admission, task leases and
   the remote registry belong to the backend/host; the frontend mirrors state, keeps
   drafts and renders optimistic UI.
3. **Every milestone ships a usable app** that connects to the real backend and
   completes a full conversation round.
4. Repo policy: files ≤ 400 lines, Apache-2.0 only (never copy zed-industries/zed
   GPL code; this repo's own `packages/*` source is fair to read and mirror),
   localized shipped UI, Chinese cause/fix comments for bugs per AGENTS.md,
   `cargo fmt --check` + `clippy --all-targets -D warnings` + `cargo test` green.

**Out of scope for parity** (decided, revisit only with a new requirement):
computer use (CUA helper, macOS TCC), remote SSH/WSL/Docker workspaces, phone relay /
bots, conversation share, whiteboard, treemapping, model-trajectory and developer-tools
panes, feedback center, resource-manager window, coding-plan purchase webview, ARMS
telemetry. Do not expose excluded capabilities as functioning controls; an explicit
unavailable message or desktop handoff is required at any future entrypoint.

## 2. Current action-level status (2026-10-06)

Historical “COMPLETED” labels counted models/helpers as user-facing parity. The table
below separates reachable functionality from remaining work and runtime evidence.
Tests alone do not establish native visual acceptance or full end-to-end parity. Current
native-only Settings results are in `SETTINGS_ACCEPTANCE.md`; `SETTINGS.md` also retains
earlier slice evidence. Subagents now has deliberate local activation and canonical
management, with native preference handoff and observed process-tree exit. The rejected
inventory was redesigned; actual visual parity and complete native actions remain unverified.

Reference Settings navigation currently offers General, Appearance, Model settings,
Browser Use, Keyboard Shortcuts, Memory, Subagents, Plugins, MCP Servers, Skills,
Commands, Hooks, and Usage stats. Hidden legacy/Computer Use/workspace-file-search
sections are not reachable reference navigation; Automations and plugin store are
workspace surfaces rather than Settings sections.

| Review/files/terminal             | Basic local panes and bounded static raster image previews are reachable. Files preview/tree replies check workspace identity and selection/reset generations; measured clicks exercise real background fixture IO and image atlas upload. Terminal scrollback drag selection and Ctrl/Cmd+C copy use alacritty's selection owner; Ctrl+C without selection retains ETX. Platform-appropriate PTY computed-output smoke passes on this Windows checkout; native image visual acceptance, macOS/Linux execution and long-tail actions remain unverified.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| Reverse RPC and launch            | `--surface desktop`, explicit responses/races/fast failures, cleared allowlisted environment, and unified roots are implemented. Account auth, official MCP auth, browser execution and host scheduling are not supplied. Current CLI reverse callsites have an automated inventory gate.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| Composer/catalog/queue            | Aggregate activity opens running/ended agents and read-only child chats; live scoped skill/plugin catalogs, queue reorder/Edit restoration and availability-gated goal Pause/Resume are reachable. Local-path attachments have explicit deletion ownership. One-shot modified delivery and plain-input/new-goal held-queue Clear/Keep/Cancel are reachable with current-owner/reviewed-ID guards and real-CLI held-queue smoke. CLI-owned draft/session slash discovery, `/init` selection and custom filtering are reachable without local fallback or prompt copies. Local `/plan` prepares an in-memory override or submits a task through ordinary input, with selector/rejection/held-queue guards. Existing-chat clipboard uploads use begin/chunk/commit with bounded source ownership and reachable Retry/Cancel; stale replies cannot attach to another composer. New-chat non-path uploads, other app-only slash routing and native race/durability evidence remain partial. |
| Settings/appearance/shortcuts     | Grouped/searchable gear/command/shortcut destination, direct-section intents, General/Appearance and complete binding vectors for supported native shortcuts are implemented. Serialized production preferences preserve unknown JSON; isolated preferences are read-only. Configured-model inspection is read-only. Keyboard/pointer/recorder/stream/re-hydration fixtures pass; accepted native visuals, complete locale/theme coverage and executable restart remain open.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| Remaining Settings sections       | Plugins Manage Installed, MCP status inspection/Open authorization and workspace/range-scoped Usage are Settings destinations. MCP authorization uses a secret-safe native opener with current owner/connection/query checks; configuration CRUD is not supplied. Memory is reachable through the guarded application preference owner and committed reverse runtime replies. Configured-model inspection is read-only. Subagents uses the unchanged full Services Host in disposable acceptance or explicitly activated local management with suspended native preference writes. Its reference-style redesign is not yet visually accepted. Provider CRUD, Browser Use, Skills, Commands and Hooks still require missing owner ports or further bounded work. No unused-field toggles are presented as supported.                                                                                                                                                                    |
| Workflows/MCP/usage/subagents     | Timeline/resume and saved project/global list, typed new-chat launch, definition inspection, run history/Open chat and eligible-run model/concurrency settings are reachable. Metadata editing and confirmed Delete/global-to-project Move are reachable with fresh-definition preflight and origin-only refresh. Projected Open run/Open successor/All runs and exact stream-gated amendment following are reachable. Focused-run artifact metadata/Refresh uses the existing journal query with parent/run/process/selection guards and safe-field decoding. Latest-version Markdown View/Retry/Close uses a bounded authorized read and passive rendering. Other artifact formats, version navigation and cross-project history/detail remain partial. Stream-confirmed settings avoid ACK-derived state. Automations/off-peak stay host-owned and fail fast.                                                                                                                       |
| Plugins                           | Store/install/enable/update/uninstall/restore/remove and Personal Source Add/Manual Refresh use captured workspace, one mutation sender and pending guards. Diagnostic errors and refreshFailure are visible; Add retains its local draft and uses a guarded directory picker. Personal Source plugin cards and guarded canonical Example Prompt prefill are reachable without destroying parent drafts. Read-only Details/Refresh and typed scoped Configure/explicit Clear/confirmed Reset use existing CLI ports with preflight, secret masking and origin-only refresh. Workspace Reset preserves options; user Reset removes its configuration. Remote-sync cancellation is excluded, not a fake local Stop.

## 2a. Remaining parity boundary (2026-10-06)

The owner clarified that the existing TypeScript backend must remain intact. The proposed
configuration-service worker and canonical service/repository changes were withdrawn;
this slice may change native frontend code, tests and specs only. Existing CLI/runtime,
service persistence, provider repositories and shared protocol implementations are not
modified to close native UI gaps. Subagents remains the highest-priority missing panel;
SUBAGENTS_SETTINGS.md records isolated implementation, rejected appearance and production gates. A
native UI must reach an existing unchanged management owner before offering writes; the
session/subagents child directory is not that owner. No new RPC claims, parallel config
writer or functioning-looking management controls may conceal the missing boundary.
Browser execution and other exclusions remain binding.

The unchanged Desktop service connection requires an Electron-transferred MessagePort;
it has no supported external GPUI attach path. Existing headless stdio reaches the
service only through a full Host with eager provider initialization and conditional
migration, not a narrow/lazy settings mode. SUBAGENTS_SETTINGS.md records source-backed
assessment and rollback verification. Opt-in local management accepts the full Host's
disclosed behavior; standalone packaging, concurrency safety and visual acceptance remain separate.

The native-only follow-up uses a Rust Services client with the unchanged full Host.
Disposable --isolated-settings remains the sole acceptance mode; ordinary local management
requires activation consent and preference-owner handoff. SERVICES_RPC.md and
SUBAGENTS_SETTINGS.md define transport, owners, forms and production gates. Backend code
remains frozen. Grouped navigation, multi-binding shortcuts and configured-model inspection
are implemented independent native slices; neither generic models nor child chats are
profile settings. Real Host tests, correlated same-CLI-server schema snapshots and actual
native creation/supported-field readback after same-executable restart pass in disposable
roots. Inspected dark/English and light/Chinese narrow captures demonstrate the redesigned
structure; full native actions and reference visual parity remain unverified. Measured
full-Host cost does not establish the lower-memory production goal.

## 3. The real blockers v1 missed

Researching the host layer (`packages/services/src/zcode-agent/zcodeAgentService.ts`,
`zcodeAgentProcessManager.ts`) shows the gap is not mostly UI. The desktop host serves
**agent → client requests** and sets **launch parameters** that change backend
behavior. Known reverse requests are now explicitly served, raced, or failed fast;
only unknown methods receive `-32601`. The current boundaries are:

| #   | Host duty (desktop source)                                                                                                                                                                                              | Effect of `-32601` / omission in GPUI                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

## 4. Current implementation slice (2026-10-06)

The action-level audit found that Settings is a missing destination, not an icon-only
omission. The implementation contract and regression cases are in `SETTINGS.md`.
Safety fixes precede preference controls: propagate failed outbound enqueue, scope and
redact RPC status errors, unify bootstrap/data-root resolution, and reject obsolete
connection pumps and restart callbacks. Preferences have one serialized background
writer; Settings navigation remains per window. The backend still owns admission,
subscriptions, revisions, and session configuration.

The settings slice covers navigation, locale, theme, interface font size, supported
shortcuts and committed Memory runtime preferences. Provider/capability settings, upload orchestration, plugin/workflow management,
and host-owned task metadata remain separate audited backlog items. Existing exclusions
in section 1 remain binding. Milestone headings below are historical implementation
checklists, not evidence that every user action is reachable or runtime-verified.

The next composer/activity contract is in `COMPOSER_PARITY.md`: one aggregate
background-work entry, safe child navigation, and per-work cancellation reuse the
existing backend projections and command boundary. Queue reorder and full-item Edit restoration now have reachable
controls with mirrored revision and accepted-delete restoration guards. Local-path
attachments do not require chunk upload. Provider, skill, hook and subagent Settings
management lack current CLI ports and remain integration-blocked, not file-edit substitutes.

## 5. Historical milestone plan

Sizes: **S** ≤ 3 days, **M** ≤ 2 weeks, **L** ≤ 5 weeks, **XL** = needs a spike first.
Each milestone lists **Requirements**, **Acceptance**, and **Landmines**.

### P0: Make what exists trustworthy (historical requirements; current status in §2)

Requirements:

- `cargo fmt` the tree; CI green on `windows-latest`.
- Pass `--surface desktop` (B6) and mirror the B7 env set (read the desktop's
  `buildHostProcessEnv` + `resolveSpawnEnv`; carry only keys whose values the GPUI app
  can actually know).
- Stop the launcher's "self-heal" that copies `zcode-builtin.json` **into the installed
  app's directory**: writing into another product's install is unsafe, and the env var
  already covers it.
- Explicit reverse-RPC table in `backend/events.rs`: each agent→client method is
  _served_, _deliberately failed fast with a reason_, or _raced_ (interactions). No
  silent `-32601` for methods listed in §3. B1/B2 fail fast with "Zai account providers
  are not supported yet; configure an API-key provider" until M11.
- API-key providers are the supported auth path: verify that keys configured in ZCode
  reach the GPUI-spawned agent (same provider config the desktop uses) and document it
  in the README troubleshooting section.
- Live pass of the v1 M1 acceptance script against a real backend; record results here.

Acceptance: CI green; a session opened in both clients gets the same system prompt
(verify via `session/debug`); the reverse-RPC table is covered by golden tests.

Landmines: changing `--surface` changes prompts for _existing_ GPUI sessions mid-flight,
so ship it as one release note. Job-object `.expect()`s in `launcher.rs` can panic the
UI process on exotic Windows setups; convert them to logged fallbacks while in there.

### M4: Composer completion (L) — historical requirements, not a completion claim

Requirements (all wire-backed):

- **Attachments**: `v4/attachment/{begin,chunk,commit,abort}`, chunk ≤ 512 KiB decoded,
  total ≤ 20 MiB (`core.ts:84-98`); `v4/attachment/put` is internal-only and must never
  be called. Sources: file picker, drag-drop (gpui external paths), clipboard image
  paste. Thumbnails via `v4/attachment/previewSource`.
- **Slash commands**: from the `workspace-config` topic's `slashCommands[]`, with
  `workspace/readPresentation` as fallback; popup filtered as you type.
- **@mentions**: files (local tree + ripgrep), sessions, skills (`skills/referenceCatalog`),
  plugins; inserted as atomic chips; sent as `context_refs` (≤ 1) / text per the desktop
  mention providers (`packages/ui/src/mentions/providers`).
- Remaining V4 commands: `forkAssistant`, `setFollowupMode` + `requestedDelivery:guide`,
  `editQueueItem`, `reorderQueueItem`, `setAssistantFeedback`, `compact`,
  `sendGoalCommand` / `pauseGoal` / `resumeGoal`, `stop{expectedForegroundExecutionId}`,
  `cancelBackgroundWork`.

- **Model/thought selectors** (`composer/menus.rs`): ely `DropdownMenu`/`Menu`
  components render the model menu grouped under provider headings
  (`Menu::group`; grouping in `composer/catalog.rs::group_models` mirrors
  `packages/ui/src/lib/modelSelectionGroups.ts`). Ely floats the panel under the
  trigger and flips it above at the window's bottom edge. The trigger shows
  `Provider/Model` only when the catalog has more than one provider group, else
  the bare model name (desktop `resolveV4ModelTriggerDisplay`). No "manage
  models" footer: gpui has no provider-settings surface to open.

Acceptance: drag a screenshot in, mention a file, run `/compact`, fork from a reply, and
reorder the queue, all matching desktop results on the same session.

Landmines:

- The desktop composer is **Lexical** (`LexicalChatInput.tsx`, 1,531 lines). gpui has no
  rich editor; chips need a custom element in the existing IME-capable `composer/input.rs`
  (UTF-16 marked ranges already handled). Keep the composer a plain string with a
  side-table of chip ranges; never let IME composition split a chip.
- `forkAssistant`, `setAssistantFeedback` are row-targeting: they need `baseLogEpoch`
  (`ROW_TARGETING_COMMANDS`), and stale retry follows §6.

### M5: Shell, settings, i18n, theme (L) — historical requirements, not a completion claim

Requirements:

- **Add project (2026-10-05)**: the Projects section header carries a "+" that
  opens a native directory picker (Electron parity: `WorkspaceSidebar`
  add-project → `PlatformChannels.SelectDirectory` =
  `dialog.showOpenDialog({openDirectory, createDirectory})`). The picked
  folder becomes a project workspace (added, activated, agent spawned) and is
  best-effort persisted to `setting.json` `recentProjects` via the
  serialized preference owner — refused while the desktop runs (it rewrites the file
  whole), in which case the project still exists for the session.
- **Settings**: read `~/.zcode/v2/setting.json` for locale, theme, font size, shortcuts,
  keep-awake, etc. **Writes only when the desktop is not running** (see landmines);
  otherwise show "change this in ZCode desktop".
- **i18n**: generate a Rust table from `packages/ui/src/i18n/locales/{en-US,zh-CN}.ts`
  (~4,980 flat keys, custom `{key}` placeholders, `IntlProvider.tsx`) with a build-time
  script; reuse key names verbatim so translations stay shared. Locale: `system | zh-CN | en-US`.
- **Theme**: Zai Dark + Zai Light + follow-system (`packages/ui/src/styles.css` tokens);
  UI font scaling per DESIGN.md: one `ui_font_size` base (default 14) and the `text-ui-*`
  ladder (+4/+2/0/−1/−2/−4/−5).
- **Shortcuts**: port the 25 commands in `packages/shared/src/shortcutCommands.ts`
  (single source of truth, including defaults); command center (Ctrl+K / Ctrl+Shift+P)
  over the `quickPickCommands.ts` catalog.
- **Sidebar parity** (B8): native task index over all `sessions-index/<ws>` topics plus
  `session/list` without a workspace filter (cross-project). Pin/archive/unread are
  host-owned task meta; locate the desktop's store before deciding read-only vs write.

Acceptance: switch to Chinese and Light theme, scale fonts to 16 px, find a task in
another project via Ctrl+K, and all of it survives restart and matches the desktop.

Landmines:

- **`setting.json` is rewritten whole** from the desktop's in-memory state
  (`settingService.ts:214`, `atomicWriteText`, in-process queue only). A GPUI write while
  the desktop runs is silently clobbered (last writer wins). Detect a running desktop
  (its single-instance lock) before writing.
- i18n source files are TypeScript, not JSON: the extractor must fail the build on
  unparseable entries rather than drop keys.
- Host-owned task meta (pin/archive) may live in the host's task storage worker; if so,
  it is unreachable without the host, so ship read-only or local-only and label it.

### M6: Lifecycle and OS integration (L) — historical requirements, not a completion claim

Requirements: multi-window (one window per workspace/session); single instance with
forward-to-first (named mutex + pipe on Windows); window size/maximized persistence
(**own key/file**, not the desktop's `desktopWindowSize`); task-completion notifications
(suppressed while focused, click focuses the task); tray with show/quit and
close-to-tray on Windows; keep-awake while a turn runs; open-in-editor / file manager;
log export (zip `~/.zcode` logs + panic log); clean quit that kills agents first.

Acceptance: run for a full workday with two windows, background notifications and
tray, with zero orphaned `app-server` processes after quit or crash.

Landmines:

- **`zcode://` scheme ownership**: the installed desktop registers `zcode://` (OAuth,
  payment, share import, `workspace/open`). If GPUI registers it too, deep links reach
  whichever registered last and the desktop's OAuth breaks. Use a distinct scheme
  (`zcode-gpui://`) or none.
- **Coexistence with the desktop on the same workspace**: both spawn their own agent for
  the same workspace key. Verify agent storage tolerates two writers (sessions DB) before
  advertising side-by-side use; otherwise warn when the desktop holds the workspace.
- gpui multi-window + the current single `RootView`/`AppState` design: `AppState` must
  become one shared entity, with per-window view state, before the second window exists.

### M7: Workflows, automations, usage, MCP, subagents (L) — historical requirements, not a completion claim

Requirements:

- **Workflows**: V4 `workflowRuns` snapshot region + `workflowRun.updated/removed` deltas
  (apply order **header → removals → upserts**, `delta.ts:117-137`); queries
  `v4/conversation/workflowRun{s,Events,Artifacts,ArtifactData,ArtifactRead,Workspace,NodeResult}`;
  commands `startSavedWorkflow`, `resumeWorkflowRun`, `amendWorkflowRunSettings`;
  saved workflows via `workflows/{list,get,updateMeta,delete,runs,move}`. Run timeline
  first; graph view later.
- **Automations / off-peak** (B4): superseded requirement. Scheduling remains
  host-owned; current GPUI reverse requests fail fast. Any future integration must
  reuse an existing host scheduler rather than create a second owner (see §7 D3).
- **Usage**: `v4/usage/stats` (legacy `usage/stats` is deprecated); native bar/line/
  heatmap drawing (no chart crate needed).
- **MCP**: `mcp/list` read-only; editing stays in the desktop (host `mcp-sync` channel).
- **Subagents / background work**: the listed projection/navigation controls exist;
  comprehensive historical browsing and native acceptance are not implied.
  - **V4 Subagents State & Projection**: `Row::Subagent` with `tool_call_id`, `subagent_type`,
    `status`, `summary_text`, `parent_tool_call_id`, `child_session_id`, `work_id`, `backgrounded`,
    and `started_at`. Incremental `row.delta` streaming appends to `summary_text` via `stream_field_mut`.
    `SubagentsState` tracks `revision`, `child_session_ids`, `running`, and `ended_total` from
    `state.updated` patch `subagents`. `join_running_subagents` merges running subagents with
    `backgroundWorks` by `child_session_id` to establish live status and cancellation control.
  - **Transcript Card Pairing**: `transcript/subagent_card.rs` pairs `Row::Subagent` beneath its
    parent `Row::ToolCall` when `tool_call_id == parent_tool_call_id` (matching web/desktop layout),
    and falls back to standalone rendering when unpaired.
  - **Dock Agents Section**: Collapsible Agents section in `review/pane.rs` (`agents_section.rs`)
    displaying running count badge, status dot, elapsed duration, truncated summary preview,
    Stop button (sends session command `cancelBackgroundWork { workId }`), and Open button. Displays
    `ended_total` counter when completed subagents exist.
  - **Child Navigation & Read-Only Gating**: Clicking Open sets `viewing_child: Option<String>` in
    `AppState`, routing `active_conversation()` to the child session while enforcing strict read-only
    mode: suppresses composer input (replaced with read-only banner), turn actions (edit/retry/fork/undo),
    and interaction cards. Top "← Back to {parent_title} ({child_session_id})" bar navigates back to
    parent and cleanly unsubscribes child session via `v4/conversation/unsubscribe`.
  - **Sessions Sidebar Filtering**: Excludes all subagent child session IDs from workspace session lists
    by aggregating `child_owner` and loaded `subagents.childSessionIds`.
  - **Follow-up Scope**: Full on-demand paginated historical drawer via `session/subagents` (for browsing
    ended subagents across past pages) remains an optional follow-up inspection tool; current state
    directly reflects live `state.updated` projection and `ended_total`.

Acceptance: start a saved workflow, watch nodes progress, view an artifact; check this
month's usage; see MCP server status; an agent-created automation either works or fails
with a clear, actionable message.

Landmines:

- **Double scheduling**: if GPUI schedules automations while the desktop also runs, jobs
  fire twice. Pick one owner (D3) and enforce it with the desktop's lock.
- `workflowRunDeltas` capability must only be declared if the host advertised it
  (`clientHello.capabilities` is strict, `transport.ts:78-86`); stdio has no hello today,
  so stay on the legacy 256-node clamp unless verified.
- Closed enums (`backgroundWorkSummary.kind`, `turnHeader.origin`) break the whole frame
  on the TS side; our parser must keep tolerating unknown values (it does; keep a
  golden test for it).

### M8: Plugin store (M) — historical requirements, not a completion claim

Requirements: `plugins/{overview,referenceCatalog,referenceCatalogWithCategory,describe,
install,update,uninstall,setEnabled,configure,resetConfig,restoreBuiltin,validate,
cancelOperation}`, `plugins/marketplace/{add,remove,update}`, progress via the
`plugins/operationProgress` notification. UI and vocabulary strictly per `CONTEXT.md`:
Official Marketplace vs Personal Source, Public/Personal segments, Featured,
Installed Strip, Manage Installed View, Catalog Auto-Refresh (silent, throttled,
official-only) vs Manual Refresh, Restorable Builtin, Orphaned Installed Plugin.

Acceptance: CONTEXT.md lifecycle end to end (add personal source → install → enable →
configure → update → uninstall → restore builtin), with state matching the desktop.

Landmines: plugin management also has host channels (`plugin-management`,
`plugin-sync`); confirm stdio covers persistence or label host-only actions. Restorable
builtins must not auto-reseed. Detail pages render markdown listings (reuse M2).

### M9: Panes long tail (M)

Reachable: per-file stage/unstage/discard, basic branch cycling, terminal scrollback
selection/copy and bounded static raster image preview. The bounded native adapters and
automated evidence are described in FILES.md and TERMINAL.md, not a full M9 completion claim.
Open: safe branch-picker owner integration, git graph, terminal tabs/context menu/persistent
sessions, host-owned file search and plan-detail long tail. PDF/Office remain external-only;
the current React renderers do not establish a native GPUI rendering implementation.

Landmines: Windows ConPTY quirks (startup cursor query handled; verify `Ctrl+C` and
resize under PowerShell 7 and cmd); terminal per window vs per workspace once M6 lands.

### M10: Distribution (M) — historical requirements, not a completion claim

Installer (NSIS or MSIX) + portable zip, icon, version from the repo; self-update via
the desktop manifest feed concept (`ManifestUpdateProvider`, stable/preview channels)
or GitHub releases; crash and log export; macOS/Linux build matrix (Linux CI needs
X11/Wayland dev packages). Webview spike (WebView2/wry) only if a browser pane becomes
a requirement; otherwise "Open in ZCode desktop".

### M11: Zai account / coding-plan auth (XL → spike first, lowest priority) - DEFERRED PER OWNER DECISION

Deferred by the owner (2026-10-03): direct API-key providers do **not** use the
provider-headers port ("普通 API 不进入此端口", `provider-runtime-headers.ts:25`), so
the app works without this. Only Zai account / coding-plan users need it. Until it
lands, P0 makes B1/B2 fail fast with "Zai account providers are not supported yet;
configure an API-key provider".

Requirements:

- **Spike (S)**: decide between
  - **(a) Reuse desktop credentials.** `credentials.json` values are AES-256-GCM with a key
    = SHA-256 of `ZCODE_CREDENTIAL_SECRET` or a host/user-derived string
    (`packages/services/src/credential/providers/credentialCipherProvider.ts:21`).
    Same-user native read is possible. Port the header construction from
    `accountRequestAuthService` (`zcodeAgentService.ts:2245-2296` path) to Rust.
  - **(b) Native login.** OAuth redirect is `zcode://oauth/callback` and needs
    `BIGMODEL_OAUTH_APP_SECRET`, which the desktop gets from its build env, not from the
    repo. That makes native OAuth likely infeasible; API-key login (`apps/zcode-cli`
    `auth-login.ts` key layout) is feasible.
  - Recommended: **(a) for account tokens + (b-API-key) for direct providers**. The
    user logs in once in the desktop app and the GPUI app reads the same store.
- Serve B1 and B2 from the chosen store; handle `interaction/providerRuntimeHeadersCancelled`.
- Token refresh: follow the desktop's refresh path; never log header values.
- Minimal account UI: signed-in identity, provider list, "Sign in via ZCode desktop" when
  no token.

Acceptance: a coding-plan account that works in the desktop chats in GPUI with no extra
steps; revoking the token in the desktop is reflected on the next request.

Landmines:

- **Credential file lock.** `credentials.json` writes use a directory lock
  (`withFileLock`, `packages/shared/src/node/privateFilePersistence.ts:51`). Any GPUI
  write must implement the same lock protocol or corrupt the desktop's store; prefer
  read-only.
- The key derivation is weak by design and slated to move to OS keychain/safeStorage
  (comment in `credentialService.ts`). Isolate it behind one Rust trait so a keychain
  migration is a one-file change.
- Secrets must never reach logs, panic messages or the `%TEMP%` panic log.

## 5. Dependency order

```
P0 ──► M4 (composer) ──► M7 (workflows/automations)
  │
  └──► M5 (shell/i18n/theme) ──► M6 (lifecycle) ──► M10 (distribution) ──► M11 (Zai auth)
                    └──► M8 (plugins)      M9 (panes) runs alongside any of them
```

This is the historical dependency graph, not a statement that CI is currently red.
The first Settings/safety slice is implemented; M4 (composer) remains a daily-use gap. M5 precedes M6 because
multi-window needs the shared-state refactor and persisted settings. M8 and M9 can be
interleaved whenever capacity frees up. M11 is last by owner decision: the owner uses
API-key providers, which work without it.

## 6. Command rules (normative, unchanged)

(`backend/session_cmds.rs`; spec: `zcode-protocol-v4/command.ts`)

- Every session command goes through `send_session_command`, which registers a
  `Pending::Command` so its `CommandAck` is checked.
- CAS commands (`COMMANDS_REQUIRING_BASE_REVISION`) take `baseRevision` from the
  mirrored conversation; row commands (`ROW_TARGETING_COMMANDS`) also need the
  snapshot `logEpoch`. With no snapshot/epoch the action is disabled; the client never
  sends a guessed revision or epoch.
- `stale` → resend once from `revisionAtDecision` with a new commandId.
  `rejected`/`failed`/second `stale`/JSON-RPC error → error banner plus a forced
  resync of the affected topic. The backend snapshot is the only rollback path for
  optimistic UI updates.
- Interactions are answered **only** through V4 `resolveInteraction`; legacy
  `interaction/requestPermission|requestUserInput` stdio requests stay unanswered (the
  backend races them, and a stdio reply loses Allow-always/Full-access). They are
  re-announced every second after a restore, so handling must be idempotent by
  `requestId`.
- Protocol timestamps are CLI-clock Unix ms; never diff them against local time.
- The mirrored `revision` comes only from the snapshot and `state.updated` patches
  (`revision_known` gates CAS until a snapshot arrives). Acks never advance it
  (no `revisionAtDecision + 1`), and `rowsRange.atRevision` never overwrites it. The
  stale retry passes `revisionAtDecision` as an explicit base; a stale ack without it
  fails. `cas_fields` enforces both spec lists centrally, whatever the call site.
- `resolveInteraction` is idempotent per `interactionId` (`ResolvingInteractions`):
  re-announced cards with an answer in flight stay hidden; a failed answer releases
  the id.
- Reverse RPC: every `automation/*` and `offPeak/*` method (including future ones)
  fails fast with `-32603`. Empty lists or `bound: false` would be false facts, and
  the CLI's binding check must fail closed. Unknown methods get the desktop's
  `-32601 "Unsupported ZCode Protocol request: <method>"`.

### Audit invariants (2026-10-03, extended 2026-10-05)

- **Transport (2026-10-05 audit P0.1/P0.2/P0.3)**: route cursors key on
  `(subscriptionId, logEpoch, seq)`; deltas apply only when
  `fromSeq == cursor.seq` (a one-event gap is a gap); stale/duplicate frames
  (`toSeq <= cursor.seq`) and old-generation frames are dropped without
  touching state; any discontinuity resyncs and returns before the reducer
  runs. The fragment assembler enforces the canonical limits and faults with
  the canonical reason codes; cursor and fragment state are cleared together
  by one registry-based cleanup used by reconnect, unsubscribe, workspace
  unload and connection restart. The stdout pump reads lines through a 2 MiB
  bounded reader (oversized lines are discarded before any large allocation);
  backlog is counted on the producer side with event+byte watermarks
  (32 MiB high / 4 MiB low latch) and a 64 MiB protocol hard bound — overflow
  resets the connection generation and explicitly starts a replacement instead of
  growing memory; the obsolete process's EOF cannot trigger another restart. stderr flows through its own bounded (4 MiB, lossy) queue and can
  never wedge event delivery.
- **Child environment (P0.4)**: the backend is spawned with `env_clear()` and
  an explicit allowlist (system basics + proxy + ZCODE data vars); variables
  like `GLM_BINARY_PATH` or `NODE_OPTIONS` can no longer leak into the agent.
  Custom CA (`NODE_EXTRA_CA_CERTS`, `SSL_CERT_FILE`, `SSL_CERT_DIR`) is
  forwarded when present.
- **Client identity (P1.10)**: `client_id` is created once under
  `<data>/v2/gpui-client-id` (parent dirs created as needed) and reused across
  processes; a missing or corrupt file is repaired atomically (tmp + rename
  replace), concurrent creators converge on one winner, and tests cover the
  repair and 4-thread convergence.
- **Sidebar lists (2026-10-05)**: the plain sidebar rows (unlike the desktop's
  virtualized list) render progressively per workspace — the 3 latest
  threads, "Load more" extends, the second click shows everything; the active
  thread stays pinned in the window even when older than it (e.g. opened via
  Ctrl+K in a long list). Project folders toggle open/closed on the header
  chevron (desktop `group-item.tsx handleHeaderClick` parity); expansion and
  load-more steps are pure `RootView` view state, never server facts. New
  projects arrive only through the native directory picker.
- **Secrets**: every sink (in-memory log, agent stderr echo, error banners,
  `lastError` text, panic log, exported log bundle) goes through
  `shared::redact::scrub` (credential keys, `Bearer`/`Basic`, `sk-`/`ghp_`/`AKIA`/JWT
  shapes).
- **Settings**: preferences/recent-project writes go through one serialized owner,
  then `persist_change` / `update_settings_checked_at`: read-modify-write of the
  current file, refused while the desktop's Electron single-instance lock
  (`<userData>/lockfile` / `SingletonLock`) or process is present (re-checked
  before the rename), refused for an unparseable file, and unset fields omitted
  (never `null`).
- **Attachments**: the upload params match the strict transport schemas
  (`connectionId`, no workspace fields); a zero-byte file declares zero chunks.
  Local absolute paths remain a valid `ref` for local workspaces.
- **Composer chips**: mentions are atomic `ChipTable` ranges. Every edit and IME
  composition widens to whole chips; caret moves step over them.
- **Transcript**: history pages `splice(0..0, n)` (no reset, so measured heights are
  kept); while following, the tail is re-pinned on every render, so a streaming last
  row stays bottom-aligned.
- **Agents**: kill-on-close job handles are RAII-owned and closed on every path; the
  `taskkill` fallback runs without a console window; `on_app_quit` kills all agents.
- **ConPTY**: the startup `ESC[6n` is reassembled across reads and only intercepted
  in the first 4 KiB, so later program queries reach alacritty.
- **Workspace refs**: every `plugins/*` and `mcp/list` payload sends
  `{ workspacePath, workspaceKey }` (`plugin_payloads::workspace_ref`). The strict
  `zcodeWorkspaceRefSchema` rejected the old path-only ref with `-32602`, so the
  plugin store and MCP list never loaded.
- **Launcher**: order is `ZCODE_GPUI_AGENT_PROGRAM`, then bun + branch source (only
  when installed and built), then the installed desktop runtime. Desktop-exported
  `GLM_BINARY_PATH` / `ZCODE_AGENT_SERVER_COMMAND` are not overrides.

## 9. Risks

1. **Model catalog harvest** via legacy `session/create` + `deleteSession` remains the
   only catalog source (no V4 query); golden-tested, but upstream can break it.
2. **Host-only surfaces grow upstream.** New desktop features often land as host
   services, not agent methods. Track `packages/shared/src/channels.ts` in the drift check.
3. **Credential format change** (keychain migration) would break M11a overnight; the
   trait boundary limits the blast radius.
4. **Local git/terminal/files** deviate from "all logic in the backend", but the desktop
   host is itself a local implementation (node-pty, git service), so no new remote
   semantics are introduced (v1 decision, kept).
5. **Process overhead**: solved pre-M0 (lazy spawn, idle unload, job-object kill);
   startup ~267 MB vs ~1 GB with eager spawn.
